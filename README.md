This thesis presents a Linear Programming formulation that addresses the simultaneous optimization of the supply chain distribution and blending problem in oil-refinery applications. Depending on the problem characteristics as well as the required flexibility in the solution, the model can be based on continuous-time domain representation.

The proposed optimization approach is oriented towards providing an effective and integrated solution for both the supply chain distribution and the blending problem. In order to provide convenient solutions for all circumstances, different alternatives to cope with infeasible problems are presented in detail. The method is presented by solving real world refinery problems with very low computational requirements.
